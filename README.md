A high score above 1000 is good.

I am new to game development and still learning the Unity Engine. For this project, I focused on the gameplay and its core mechanic using a simple cubist style.

__Hours:__ The game's core concept took 3 hours to develop, but attempts to add sound and polishing added far too many hours to the project.

__Development Team:__ Just myself, all the code, design, and sounds were produced by me.

This is the first game that I submitted to TriJam. The concept of this game was coded relatively quickly; however, adding sound correcting screen size display issues took far longer than I hoped for. The part following the classic 90/10 rule, the last 10% of software development, took 90% of the time.

I'm pleased with the final game, although I welcome feedback, particularly any bugs or glitches that I missed. One of the issues I struggled with is the difference in the final presentation between the webGL on itch io playing in the unity development. I have a lot to learn. Feedback is most welcome

I look forward to applying myself to future game jams as I find it an excellent way to focus on what I have been learning the last few weeks.

I will return to this project when I have learned more about animation.
